# Curriculum Vitae

## Context

During my second year of studying Business Information Technology, I had a two-week course on web services. In the first week, we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, both theoretically and practically.

Once I understood the fundamentals, I was given a project to build a website that would serve as a digital CV. This project helped me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and showed me how these languages are used in the real world.

In the second week, we focused on Vue.js. We learned how Vue.js simplifies web development by enabling the creation of interactive user interfaces. With Vue.js, I added dynamic and interactive elements to my digital CV website, making it more engaging for users. This experience made me appreciate web development even more and motivated me to continue studying and improving my skills.

## Instructions for the project

- Website must be responsive thanks to Bootstrap
- Website must use the Chart.js plugin
- Website must use another JavaScript plugin (I choose Darkmode.js)
- Project must include a README file describing the process and the resources used
